## ansible-collection-wip

This is the home of Ansible roles and playbooks that have been put together for one reason or another, but have not yet
been polished for publication. No guarantee is made that anything here will be maintained, however some challenges may
have been overcome in producing these so there may be some lessons to learn from the YAML herein.

Generally roles will be targeting the latest release of Debian GNU/Linux. As new releases are approaching, sometimes
I'll jump the gun and start targeting the unreleased next version as it is usually ready for production anyway. The
Debian people just like to get everything perfect before they hit the release button.

### Usage

Use these as examples, but I would strongly recommend you do not include these directly in your IaC.
If something here fits your needs really well, maybe [get in touch](https://irl.xyz/contact/) with me and check if I'm
planning to maintain that role or playbook.
Sometimes a bit of external motivation is the push I need to get something finished, otherwise you can always
[hire me to do it](https://www.sr2.uk/).
